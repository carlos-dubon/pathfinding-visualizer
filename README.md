A visualization tool for **Dijkstra’s pathfinding algorithm** and **Prim’s maze generation algorithm**. Find the shortest path from a source to a destination. This project is based on graph theory.

## Dijkstra's algorithm 
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

## Prim's algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957 and Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959.

## Difference between Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm

Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path, but Prim’s algorithm finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

In practice, Dijkstra’s algorithm is used when we want to save time and fuel traveling from one point to another. Prim’s algorithm, on the other hand, is used when we want to minimize material costs in constructing roads that connect multiple points to each other.
